How to make Chicken Drumsticks
Step 1
Chicken Drumstick is a simple yet delicious appetizer recipe, which can be prepared in just a few minutes with some very easily available ingredients. Traditionally this recipe was made using the dry fry procedure. However, we have recreated this delicious recipe in a much more healthy way by cooking it in a microwave. Preparing it in this way will retain the flavours by using very less melted butter. You can also use fat-free butter.

Wash and clean the chicken pieces. Take a large bowl and combine flour, black pepper, paprika, curry powder along with chicken seasoning. Add salt according to your taste. In the meantime, preheat the oven at 230 degree Celsius.

Step 3
Once done, coat the chicken drumsticks properly with the prepared seasoning. Next, arrange them on the baking dish which is to be foiled and greased with half of the melted butter.

Bake for about 30 minutes or at least until the chicken turns golden brown. Once well-baked, take out, let it cool for a while and serve it with any dip of your choice.If you are fond of Indian flavours you can serve it with green chutney and some lip-smacking drinks.
